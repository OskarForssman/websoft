<h2>S01</h2>
<p>
    Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
    Yes we have used github over ther last 2 semesters we noramlly use it in our projects. 
    Im familiar with the git , github commandos such as push , pull ,add ,remodled and so on,
    but i got no real deep understanding in gith except those commandos. I never used github Pages
    and i am quite in shock how easy it is to do a website with it. Markdown ive never heard off.
    
    Have you ever created websites before?
    No i have not created websites before but im looking forward to it. Just basic things that i dont even regards as a website
    so it gonna be very fun to do this.

    Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
    I dont have much knowledge about new things just the old jsp file and xml files to create basic webpages.
    Long time ago in highschool i did a course in basic webdevelopment which in cluded jsp as stated.
    But it was very basic and more or less just drag and drop.

    What is your TIL for this course section?
    I have alwaysed hear about the words angular,javascript,react and son on but never truly set myself into them.
    What im looking forward to is learning those topics and prehaps a more work standard due to the other courses we had
    have been very old stuff that arnt been used at companies today.

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>
    Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
    No, i got no previus experience in this i looked into css abit in a previous project but nothing worth the name.
    Im looking forward to get more experience and knowledge in all of these 3  topics. Even through im not a big fan of frontend.

    Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
    CSS controlling a page's appearance , how will the page look.
    JavaScript programming its functionality.
    Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a programming language used to describe the structure of information on a web page.

    Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
    HTTP is a classic "client-server" protocol. Users click a link on their web browser (the client),
    and the browser sends a request over the internet to a web server that houses the site the user requested.
    
    What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    Im sitting alot in CSS and testing things atm. My goal is to understand how the backend works with javascript,html , serverside.
    But also becoming a better frontend developer which im dreadful at atm.
