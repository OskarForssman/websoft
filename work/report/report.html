<h2>S01</h2>
<p>
    Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?
    Yes we have used github over ther last 2 semesters we noramlly use it in our projects. 
    Im familiar with the git , github commandos such as push , pull ,add ,remodled and so on,
    but i got no real deep understanding in gith except those commandos. I never used github Pages
    and i am quite in shock how easy it is to do a website with it. Markdown ive never heard off.
    
    Have you ever created websites before?
    No i have not created websites before but im looking forward to it. Just basic things that i dont even regards as a website
    so it gonna be very fun to do this.

    Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.
    I dont have much knowledge about new things just the old jsp file and xml files to create basic webpages.
    Long time ago in highschool i did a course in basic webdevelopment which in cluded jsp as stated.
    But it was very basic and more or less just drag and drop.

    What is your TIL for this course section?
    I have alwaysed hear about the words angular,javascript,react and son on but never truly set myself into them.
    What im looking forward to is learning those topics and prehaps a more work standard due to the other courses we had
    have been very old stuff that arnt been used at companies today.

</p>

<h2>S02</h2>
<p>
    Have you any previous experience of HTML, CSS and/or JavaScript?
    No, i got no previus experience in this i looked into css abit in a previous project but nothing worth the name.
    Im looking forward to get more experience and knowledge in all of these 3  topics. Even through im not a big fan of frontend.

    Explain the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript in web development.
    CSS controlling a page's appearance , how will the page look.
    JavaScript programming its functionality.
    Hypertext Markup Language, or HTML, is a programming language used to describe the structure of information on a web page.

    Give a brief explanation of how the browser, the HTTP protocol and the web server interacts.
    HTTP is a classic "client-server" protocol. Users click a link on their web browser (the client),
    and the browser sends a request over the internet to a web server that houses the site the user requested.
    
    What is your TIL for this course section?</p>
    Im sitting alot in CSS and testing things atm. My goal is to understand how the backend works with javascript,html , serverside.
    But also becoming a better frontend developer which im dreadful at atm.
</section>

<section>
<h2>S03</h2>
<p> Do you have any previous experience of client side JavaScript? No i have no previus experience with javascript
    neither client side or serverside.
    Can you compare and relate the JavaScript language to any other language you know?
    Havnt really worked in that many language just java , mathlabb and this but its a simpler java when we did 
    css with android studio u have to control the xml file and it took long to update the app. Here its a instant
    click and the website is updated.
    Describe how you worked with the coding exercise, what grade do you aim for and how did your code turn out to be?
    As we have problem with our examwork due to our project idea was stolen by some other group we were forced to
    focus on the project plan for the product and idea. So ive only done the grade 3 task atm. If i get more
    time before the 16 feb i will continue and finish grade 4 and 5.
    What is your TIL for this course section? Ive now realised the importance of structure the code, since i
    had alot of redundancy i rework the code alot and split it up in diffrent classes but i still have some
    redundancy so i need to work on that and remeber that</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>S04</h2>
<p> How do you feel about working with JavaScript, Node and Express?
    I feel like javascript,node and express isnt for me due to i dont like the frontend part. But i had a good time
    since it easy to update implement and fix things. So i might could change my mind after this course xd!
    Explain how you did take on the coding assignment, did you have a plan and did it work?
    My goal was not to follow the teachers video, i rather focused on finish it myself with the information provided
    in the lecture slides and example tasks. I tried to create an own route with js that sends randomize 7 numbers to ejs
    while i in ejs just print the numbers. This was quite easy todo and follow, i only had abit hard to understand how the json works 
    but aswell as some syntax but worked out fine in the end.
    What grade did you aim for and was it a difficult level?
    I just aimed for grade 3 we have alot of work todo in the examwork so i couldnt make the time to do the higher grades. when
    we only got the writing left for exam work and i feel like i have catched up i will finish all the tasks grade.
    What is your TIL for this course section?
    I learned the syntax of javascript and html. Aswell as how u can make javascript and html work together in a
    ejs file.
</p>

<h2>S05</h2>
<p>
    How do you feel about PHP as a programming language?
    It was kinda similair to the html and js i thought, i did more or less the same for the header,nav.. in javascript
    and html. Was quite nice they way it could produce dynamic webpages. I need some more hours to give a better assesment 
    because ive simply just done the task but it seemd fun similair and easy going at first sight!.
    Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?
    PHP and Java are both very similar when it comes to the benefits provided, 
    but they are both very different. PHP is a server side scripting language, 
    while Java is a client side choice. When you use PHP code, 
    you will execute it in the actual server,
    while Java will be executed on your client's computer.
    Describe how you took on the coding exercise, what grade did you aim for and are you satisfied with the result?
    Due to alot of work with examwork ive only focused the grade 3 if i get time which i think i will have in begining
    of march i will continue and aim for higher grades. My result was ok i think i have some redundacy with css and 
    some code that need to be fixed and i will do.
    What is your TIL for this course section?
    Do my own connection im not that big fan off getting provided all code and just ctrl c+ ctrl v so i will go 
    through the code and do my own to truly test php as stated above.

<h2>S06</h2>

    <p>
    What is your own opinion on popularity of programming languages and what are your thoughts of future popularity among programing languages?
    In todays climate it seems programming languages that can be used for machine learning is whats the future. Almost all companies and goverments
    want to implement machine learning in a variety of diffrent functionality to help them. Even through you can more or less do machine learning 
    in every programming language, languagues like python,c++ is the preferd and got a big popularity. In otherhand some langagues such as java in certain
    scenarios are getting replaced. Java have gone to kotlin which is a simplyfied easier way of writing java code. I feel like its runs much smoother and
    is much esier to handle certain syntax. I feel like in the future remodled old popular language and simplifications of existing one is what we 
    are striving for!.

</p>
    <p>
    What will be your own choice for selecting future programming languages?
    Due to the fact im intressted doing a master  programming in machine learning i will strive to learn python which most of todays machine learning scripts 
    is written in. Another choice is a programming language thats easy to get job with like javascript or css, should be worth my time continue with these languages
    to become more fluent in them. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Do your own investigation on https://trends.google.com (Links to an external site.) to customize your own comparison on programming languages (or frameworks) and elaborate on the results.
    If you were to recommend a language/framework/technology to your potential employer and your next large project, what would it be and how would you “sell it”?
    
    Low level/High level: Originally, we divided languages based on High level or Low level. COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, C, PASCAL were known as high level languages, in contrast to Assembler or Machine Level Languages.

    3rd, 4th and 5th Generation Languages: Languages were classified in this manner with 3rd gen. covering the procedural languages (COBOL, C, PASCAL, FORTRAN etc.), 4th gen. covering languages that were closer to
     human language (SQL, Informix 4GL) and 5th gen. languages as those that solved specific problems within given constraints.

     Procedural, OO, Functional: Then came the classifications of Procedural COBOL, C, PASCAL, FORTRAN etc., Object Oriented (Smalltalk, Java, C++ etc) and Functional Languages (Common Lisp
     , Scheme, Clojure, Erlang, Haskell, and F#).

     Static or dynamically typed languages: Another classification style classifies languages based on if the Object types checking is done at compile (fr example Java, C++ etc) time or run time.

     Interpreted and compiled languages: Interpreted languages are not compiled and run using an interpreter. Many scripting languages are interpreted.

     Database Languages: In 80s and 90s, clipper, DBase etc were very popular languages. Among other things, people wrote accounting, inventory management, order management softwares in these. These are also somewhat of 4GLs.

     Concurrent v/s Single threaded languages: As the name suggests, the languages that provide concurrent programming models as their prime purpose, get categorized under this section. 
     Notable are Java threads, Kotlin Coroutines, AKKA Actors etc.

     This is just some of the programming language types i find. To even begin to recommend something from a potential employer i must know all around that project what its goal is and so on and with that information i could do
     good judgement and provide it to them.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    What is your TIL for this course section?
    Well this 3years program is soon ending, ive learned java and the things we have had in the courses but its time to push it further. Really get into python or 
    any other programmin language i think suit me and i would want to work with the rest of my life!.

<h2>S08</h2>
<p>
    What is your TIL for this course section?
    Well its always usefull to learn about how diffrent sites work and functions. My goal is to go through the source code
    from these sites to see its source code the understand deeper why their practise are good and how they have programmed
    their website.

<h2>S09</h2>
<p>Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns, from your own experience, related to web application security and relate them to the OWASP top ten.
    Summarize by providing your own guidelines to a new web programmer on the topic “The essential guidelines to follow to create secure web applications”.
  For me it can be alot of security aspects, Cross Line scripting attack while a person can try to add a dangerous script to ur webapp.
  Hacking of cookies which can enable a hacker to get access to information such as db tables etc. Eavesdropping if u dont use https for secure http. In essence
  today you have to think about everything to get ur website safe. The bigger it get the more people wanna hack it for fun or wadever you must take intrest in the website
  having it like a job and fun to always make ur website as safe as possible. Also try to make everything encrypted,https,no leak of information from cookies or scripts.
  It can be alot of work but all information is out there.
</p>
<p>What is your TIL for this course section?
    I havnt programmed any cookies it would be nice to accually test to program one. Aswell as https and the new https 2 which i read about in the last course and seem relevant
    atm.
